  NOTE: For MacOS, OVERCLOCK can take 30-45 seconds to open after its icon first appears in the application dock. Please be patient with it :-)

‚ú® WHAT IS OVERCLOCK?
OVERCLOCK allows you to build, simulate, and learn about watt-bit infrastructure. Drag-and-drop components, connect them, and run time-based simulations to understand energy flow, operations, and project economics.

üöÄ CORE FEATURES
1. üîß Visual Modeling
   - Drag-and-drop components from the left-hand "Components" panel.
   - Components: Gas Generator, Battery Storage, Electrical Bus, Load, Cloud Workload, Grid Import/Export, Solar Array, Wind Turbine, Props.
   - Create connections with the **C** key or **Create Connection** button; use **A** to Autoconnect All.
   - Select components to edit parameters (capacity, cost, efficiency) in the floating Properties panel (toggle in **View** menu).
2. ‚è±Ô∏è Time-Based Simulation
   - **Space:** Run/Pause hourly simulation.
   - **R:** Reset simulation to time 0.
   - **Time Slider:** Scrub through 8760 hours (1 year).
   - **Speed Control:** Adjust playback speed (1x, 2x, 3x).
3. üìà Analysis & Insights
   - **CAPEX Display:** Shows total capital expenditure, updated on changes.
   - **IRR Display:** Calculates Internal Rate of Return for 12, 18, 36-month refresh cycles.
   - **Analytics Panel (P):** Real-time charts of generation, consumption, capacity.
   - **Historian View (\\):** Historical time-series charts after Autocomplete.
4. ü§ñ Autocomplete (Enter)
   - Runs full-year simulation in the background.
   - Switches to Historian view on completion.
   - Displays final IRR.
5. üíæ Scenario Management
   - **Model ‚Üí Save/Load/New** to manage designs in JSON format.
6. üñºÔ∏è Other Features
   - **Screenshot:** Capture build or historian views.
   - **Zoom:** Zoom modeling view.
   - **Background Toggle:** Change canvas background.
   - **Hotkeys:** See below.

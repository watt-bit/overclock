## ✨  What Is OVERCLOCK?

OVERCLOCK lets you model, simulate, and analyze watt-bit infrastructure — everything from natural gas and solar arrays feeding GPU clouds to grid-export revenue plays — over a full 8760-hour year. 

A rich and high-impact user experience driven by opinionated design and configuration, careful attention to detail, more than 50 original graphics assets, and input from dozens of subject matter experts.

## 🚀  Core Features

1. **Node-Based Visual AI Infra Modeling**  
   * Drag-and-drop components (Generator, Battery, Grid Import/Export, Bus, Load, Cloud, Solar, Wind, Props). 
   * **C** to create a connection, **A** to Autoconnect All.  
   * Properties panel allows configuration of deep component operational simulation with multiple smart modes per component. Defaults "just work".
   * Powerlandia data sets offer moderate-fidelity simulations "out of the box".

2. **Time-Based Simulation**  
   * **Space** – run/pause; **R** – reset.  
   * Slider scrubs the full year

3. **Analysis & Insights**  
   * Live **CAPEX** & **IRR** (12/18/36-mo refresh).  
   * **Analytics Panel (P)** – real-time charts.  
   * **Historian (\\)** – full-year data after Autocomplete.

4. **Autocomplete (Enter)**  
   * Runs the whole year in background, flips to Historian, and shows final IRR.

5. **Scenario Management** – Save/Load/New JSON designs.

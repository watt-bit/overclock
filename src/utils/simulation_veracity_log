## 2024-03-26 04:45 - Milestone: Architecture Restructuring Complete

With the completion of the ModelManager extraction, we have successfully restructured the application architecture into cleanly separated modules. The simulation logic verification completed earlier confirmed that:

1. All power flow calculations are properly encapsulated in the SimulationEngine
2. The simulation maintains energy conservation principles
3. Component interactions follow a consistent priority order
4. Battery state tracking works correctly

The refactoring has maintained this core simulation behavior while improving code organization. The application now has:
- Clean separation between UI, simulation logic, and persistence
- More maintainable, single-responsibility modules
- Preserved functionality with improved structure

Next steps for simulation veracity would be to address the previously identified limitations:
- Implementing more realistic power system constraints
- Adding network topology considerations
- Incorporating frequency dynamics
- Enhancing economic dispatch functionality

These improvements can now be more easily implemented due to the clean separation of concerns in the architecture.

## 2024-07-05 - Comprehensive SimulationEngine Analysis

### Review Scope
- Conducted detailed analysis of src/simulation/engine.py
- Examined simulation flow and calculation logic
- Reviewed energy conservation principles
- Analyzed component interaction and priority order
- Evaluated revenue calculation mechanisms

### Key Findings

1. Simulation Architecture
   - Well-structured multi-pass approach ensures proper priority order
   - Clear separation between time management and simulation updates
   - Strong encapsulation of simulation state with proper initialization
   - Elegant design pattern with main window reference for scene access

2. Power Flow Calculations
   - Eight-pass algorithm with clear priority hierarchy:
     * Pass 1: Calculate total load, generator capacity, find batteries
     * Pass 2: Calculate local generation (priority order: Static > BTF Unit Commitment > BTF Droop)
     * Pass 3: Use battery discharge for remaining load
     * Pass 4: Use grid import for remaining load
     * Pass 5: Charge batteries with surplus power
     * Pass 6: Proactively charge batteries using available generator capacity
     * Pass 7: Use grid import to charge batteries if capacity available
     * Pass 8: Export surplus power to grid
   - Consistent energy conservation principles throughout all passes
   - Proper handling of remaining load and surplus power between passes

3. Generator Control Strategies
   - Sophisticated implementation of multiple operating modes:
     * Static (Auto): Fixed output regardless of system load
     * BTF Unit Commitment (Auto): Responds to remaining load after Static generators
     * BTF Droop (Auto): Shares load equally among multiple generators based on percentage
   - Proper implementation of ramp rate limiting for BTF Droop generators
   - Clean handling of generator state between simulation steps

4. Battery Management
   - Comprehensive battery charging/discharging logic
   - Multiple charging pathways (surplus power, generator capacity, grid import)
   - Proper energy accounting during charge/discharge operations
   - Battery state preservation between simulation steps

5. System Stability
   - Implementation of stability tolerance to handle minor imbalances
   - Clear stability flags to indicate system status
   - Proper handling of load satisfaction during instability

6. Revenue Calculations
   - Multi-source revenue tracking:
     * Load component revenue based on energy consumed and price
     * Cloud workload revenue from data center loads
     * Export revenue from grid exports with bulk PPA pricing
   - Proper accumulation and time-step handling for revenue calculations
   - Comprehensive gross revenue data array for historical tracking

7. Time Management
   - Steps permanently fixed at 1 to maintain simulation fidelity
   - Proper handling of timeline scrubbing vs. regular simulation
   - Clean state management during time transitions

### Notable Optimizations
- Stability tolerance prevents small rounding errors from triggering instability
- Efficient sorting of generators by operating mode to maintain priority order
- Smart use of component iteration to minimize redundant calculations
- Clean handling of time steps for energy accounting

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- Potential for more sophisticated power flow calculations with network topology
- Opportunity to add transmission constraints between components
- Possibility for frequency response modeling in future versions
- Potential to expand economic dispatch algorithms for generators

### Conclusion
The SimulationEngine implements a robust, physically accurate power system simulation with proper energy conservation principles. The multi-pass approach ensures correct priority order for power sources while maintaining system stability tracking. The implementation effectively balances simulation accuracy with computational efficiency.

The revenue calculation system provides a strong foundation for financial analysis, with comprehensive tracking of multiple revenue streams. The code organization facilitates future enhancements while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing components and saved models.

# Simulation Veracity Log

This log tracks detailed analysis of the simulation system's architecture, logic, and behavior.

## 2024-03-26 03:30 - Initial Simulation Logic Encapsulation Review

### Scope of Review
- Examined simulation logic distribution across codebase
- Verified encapsulation of power flow calculations
- Analyzed component interactions and state management
- Reviewed UI coordination with simulation engine

### Findings
1. Simulation Logic Location
   - All power flow calculations are properly encapsulated in SimulationEngine class
   - No simulation logic found in UI layer
   - Components maintain clean separation of concerns

2. Component Architecture
   - Components only manage their own state
   - No direct component-to-component interactions
   - Clear interface between components and simulation engine

3. UI Integration
   - MainWindow properly delegates to SimulationEngine
   - No power flow calculations in UI layer
   - Clean coordination of simulation state

4. Code Organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined responsibilities
   - Maintainable architecture

### Conclusion
The simulation logic is successfully encapsulated in the SimulationEngine class, with proper separation between UI coordination, component state management, and power flow calculations. The architecture supports maintainability and future enhancements while preserving existing functionality.

### Next Steps
- Regular verification of simulation logic encapsulation
- Monitoring of any new simulation-related code additions
- Periodic review of component interactions
- Validation of power flow calculations

## 2024-03-26 04:45 - Milestone: Architecture Restructuring Complete

With the completion of the ModelManager extraction, we have successfully restructured the application architecture into cleanly separated modules. The simulation logic verification completed earlier confirmed that:

1. All power flow calculations are properly encapsulated in the SimulationEngine
2. The simulation maintains energy conservation principles
3. Component interactions follow a consistent priority order
4. Battery state tracking works correctly

The refactoring has maintained this core simulation behavior while improving code organization. The application now has:
- Clean separation between UI, simulation logic, and persistence
- More maintainable, single-responsibility modules
- Preserved functionality with improved structure

Next steps for simulation veracity would be to address the previously identified limitations:
- Implementing more realistic power system constraints
- Adding network topology considerations
- Incorporating frequency dynamics
- Enhancing economic dispatch functionality

These improvements can now be more easily implemented due to the clean separation of concerns in the architecture.

   - Preserving state management
   - Not "improving" working code

2. UI and Logic Separation
   - Clean separation between UI (main_window.py) and simulation logic (engine.py)
   - UI delegates to simulation engine without knowing implementation details
   - Components remain independent of simulation logic

3. State Management
   - Simulation state centralized in SimulationEngine
   - Clear ownership of simulation flags and counters
   - Consistent time step handling
   - Battery state properly tracked

4. Critical Dependencies
   - Battery logic tightly coupled with time step calculations

   - Move code without changing it
   - Test thoroughly after each change
   - Keep UI interaction patterns unchanged
   - Maintain exact compatibility with existing components 

## Component Properties System Extraction (2024-03-26)
1. UI Component Separation
   - Properties management is a distinct concern from main window management
   - Each component type has its own property display logic
   - Property validation and updates should be centralized
   - UI state management for properties should be encapsulated

2. Signal Handling
   - Component click signals need careful management when switching between modes
   - Signal connections/disconnections must be properly sequenced
   - Multiple handlers may need to be coordinated (properties, connections, etc.)

3. Property Management Patterns
   - Each component type requires specific property fields and validation
   - Numeric input handling needs consistent validation and formatting
   - Custom profile loading requires proper error handling and UI feedback
   - Property updates should trigger appropriate simulation updates

4. Code Organization
   - Property-related code should be grouped by component type

   - UI layout management should be encapsulated
   - Property state should be managed independently of main window state

5. Testing Considerations
   - Property display should be verified for each component type
   - Validation logic should be tested with various inputs
   - Custom profile loading should be tested with different file formats
   - Property updates should be verified to trigger correct simulation updates 

## Connection Management System Extraction (2024-03-26)
1. Clear Interface Boundaries
   - Connection-related operations form a cohesive group of functionality
   - Connection state management should be encapsulated in a single class
   - Both connection creation and severing follow similar patterns
   - Connection validation is a separate concern from UI management

2. Cross-Component Communication
   - Connection manager needs to interact with main window, scene, and components
   - State needs to be synchronized between manager and main window (e.g., creating_connection flag)
   - Signal handling requires careful coordination between classes
   - Event filtering can be delegated while maintaining proper control flow

3. Cursor and Visual Feedback
   - Connection operations have distinct visual feedback requirements
   - Cursor changes provide important user feedback
   - Temporary visual elements (like connection lines) need proper lifecycle management
   - Animation effects should be managed in a single location

4. Algorithmic Complexity
   - Autoconnection algorithms are complex and form a cohesive unit
   - Graph-based operations benefit from being grouped together
   - Component type identification and special handling is a discrete concern
   - Connection validation is a separate concern from creation

5. Refactoring Strategy
   - Extract related methods as a complete unit
   - Maintain state in both old and new classes during transition
   - Delegate method calls without changing signatures
   - Keep event handling compatible with existing patterns 

## Architecture and Design Review (2024-03-26)
1. Overall Architecture
   - The application now follows a clean, modular architecture with distinct layers:
     * UI Layer: Main window and specialized UI managers
     * Component Layer: Power system components with defined behaviors
     * Simulation Layer: Encapsulated simulation logic
     * Connection Layer: Component relationship management
   - Clear entry point through main.py with minimal bootstrapping logic
   - Well-defined module boundaries with appropriate imports

2. Design Patterns
   - Manager Pattern: Specialized classes that handle specific concerns
   - Observer Pattern: Components observe and react to state changes
   - Command Pattern: Actions encapsulated as discrete operations
   - Dependency Injection: Managers receive required dependencies
   - Proxy Pattern: Main window delegates to specialized managers

3. Separation of Concerns
   - UI logic separated from simulation logic
   - Component behavior separated from connection logic
   - Property management separated from main window management
   - Animation and cursor handling encapsulated in respective managers

4. Code Quality Improvements
   - Reduced duplication through proper extraction
   - Better cohesion with related functionality grouped together
   - Lower coupling between different subsystems
   - Improved readability with focused classes and methods
   - Consistent method signatures and naming conventions

5. Refactoring Strategy Lessons
   - Incremental extraction is safer than full rewrites
   - Maintain backward compatibility at each step
   - Extract complete logical units rather than individual methods
   - Use composition over inheritance for flexibility
   - Test after each significant change
   - Document architectural decisions in logs 

## Feature Removal Strategy (2024-03-26)
Key lessons from removing the non-functional fuel concept:

1. Code Auditing and Impact Analysis
   - Perform thorough search across the entire codebase for all references
   - Identify all files and systems that use the feature
   - Look for both direct references (variable names) and indirect dependencies
   - Evaluate the impact of removal on each affected system
   - Map out all code paths that would need modification

2. Cross-Component Dependencies
   - Fuel concept had dependencies across multiple components:
     * Generator component properties and methods
     * Simulation engine calculations
     * Analytics panel parameter handling
     * Properties UI elements
     * JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Removing a feature requires coordinated changes across these components
   - Each dependency point must be modified consistently

3. Method Signature Changes
   - Analytics method signature required updating
   - Simulation engine calls to analytics had to be updated to match
   - Such signature changes create cascading update requirements

4. Minimal Intervention Principle
   - Feature removal should avoid changing unrelated code
   - Prefer simple removal over complex refactoring when deprecating features
   - Keep changes focused solely on the target feature
   - Maintain exact compatibility with remaining features

5. Backward Compatibility Considerations
   - Loading existing save files might reference removed properties
   - Added backward compatibility code to handle missing fields
   - Used defensive coding (checking if properties exist before accessing) 

## Financial Feature Temporary Removal (2024-03-26)
Key lessons from removing monetary/cost-related functionality:

1. Feature Identification and Isolation
   - Money-related code was concentrated in specific areas of the codebase:
     * GridImportComponent (import_cost property and calculate_import_cost method)
     * GridExportComponent (export_price property and calculate_export_revenue method)
     * SimulationEngine (cost calculation variables and aggregation logic)
     * Analytics panel (net_cost parameter)
     * Properties UI (cost/price input fields and currency symbols)
   - These features were well-encapsulated and easier to remove than deeply integrated ones

2. Incremental Feature Removal
   - Removed functionality in one category without impacting core simulation behavior
   - Cost tracking was a "read-only" feature that didn't affect power flow calculations
   - Made it possible to cleanly remove without side effects on critical functionality

3. UI Considerations
   - Removing UI elements required careful attention to layout management
   - Removed currency symbols and price/cost fields from property panels
   - Property manager handled input validation and state updates for these fields

4. Dead Code Detection
   - Some cost-related code was only used in one place
   - Calculating values that weren't displayed elsewhere
   - Removing one feature highlighted code that was only supporting that feature

5. Serialization Impact
   - JSON serialization/deserialization was affected by property removal
   - Loading saved files required handling missing properties
   - Saving files would now exclude these properties 

## Model Manager Extraction (2024-03-26)

### Key Insights
1. **File Handling Isolation**: Extracting file operations into a dedicated class improves separation of concerns and keeps the UI layer focused on presentation.

2. **Preservation of Dialog Behavior**: When extracting file dialogs, it's important to preserve the parent window reference for proper modal behavior and platform-specific appearance.

3. **Component Registration Management**: The serialization and deserialization processes highlight the importance of maintaining consistent component registration with the scene.

4. **Backward Compatibility Handling**: The load functionality contains several defensive coding patterns (using .get() with defaults) to handle loading older save files.

5. **State Reset Procedures**: The new_scenario method shows the importance of thoroughly resetting all state when clearing a scene, including UI state, simulation state, and visual elements.

6. **Clean Delegation**: By maintaining identical method signatures while delegating to a specialized class, we achieve better code organization without requiring changes to calling code.

7. **Centralized File Format Management**: Having all serialization/deserialization logic in one place will make it easier to evolve the file format in the future. 

## Milestone: Clean Module Separation (2024-03-26)

The project has reached an important architectural milestone with the completion of several key refactorings:

1. **Simulation Logic Extraction**: Simulation engine extracted into a dedicated class with clear responsibility
2. **Component Properties Management**: Properties handling extracted into a dedicated management system
3. **Connection Management**: Connection logic extracted into a dedicated system
4. **Financial Feature Removal**: Temporary removal of non-critical cost calculations to simplify the codebase
5. **Model Management**: Save/load functionality extracted from UI layer into dedicated ModelManager

These refactorings have transformed the codebase from a monolithic design to a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- UI layer now focuses purely on presentation and user interaction
- Simulation layer handles power flow calculations and time advancement
- Component layer manages individual power system elements
- Model layer handles persistence and serialization

This milestone represents the successful application of SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and has positioned the codebase for easier maintenance and future enhancements. 

## Exit Confirmation Implementation (2024-03-26)

### Key Insights
1. **Application Lifecycle Management**: Qt applications rely on specific event handlers like `closeEvent` for handling application shutdown, providing an opportunity to intercept and control the exit process.

2. **Context-Aware Confirmations**: Different confirmation messages and options should be presented based on the current application state (e.g., running simulation requires different handling than idle state).

3. **Intuitive User Flow**: The confirmation dialogs follow a logical sequence: first check critical operations (running simulation), then handle data persistence (save prompt).

4. **Multi-Option Dialogs**: Providing Yes/No/Cancel options gives users complete control over the application's behavior during exit.

5. **State-Dependent Default Choices**: Setting safer defaults (No for exiting running simulation, Yes for saving) guides users toward data-preserving choices.

6. **Quality of Life Improvements**: Small usability enhancements like exit confirmations significantly improve user experience with minimal code changes.

7. **Asynchronous Operation Handling**: The closeEvent handler properly handles the asynchronous nature of user interaction, allowing the application to continue if the user cancels the exit process. 

## Zoom Implementation Techniques (2024-03-26)

### Key Insights
1. **QGraphicsView Transformations**: Qt's QGraphicsView provides built-in scaling functionality through transform matrices, making it straightforward to implement zoom functionality.

2. **Selective Scaling**: We can selectively scale different elements (e.g., keep text size consistent while scaling images) by applying inverse scale factors to text rendering.

3. **Scale-Invariant Rendering**: Using the inverse of the view transform scale factor (`1.0 / view.transform().m11()`) allows us to maintain consistent text sizes across different zoom levels.

4. **UI Feedback for Zoom Level**: Including a visible zoom level indicator provides important user feedback about the current state of the view.

5. **Transform Management**: It's important to reset transforms before applying new ones to avoid compounding scaling effects.

6. **Painter State Management**: Using `painter.save()` and `painter.restore()` ensures that transformations applied for one element don't affect others.

7. **Zoom Range Limitations**: Limiting the zoom range (0.2x to 1.0x) prevents usability issues that could arise from extreme zoom levels. 

## Attribute Name Consistency in Serialization Code (2024-03-26)

### Key Insights
1. **Consistency in Naming**: Ensuring that attribute names in serialization code are consistent and meaningful helps maintain readability and maintainability of the code.

2. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Using clear and descriptive names can prevent confusion and errors when deserializing data.

3. **Future-Proofing**: Consistent naming conventions make it easier to update serialization code in the future if the data structure changes.

4. **Code Readability**: Consistent naming improves the readability of the code, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain.

5. **Error Prevention**: Consistent naming can help prevent errors in deserialization by ensuring that the data structure matches the expected format. 

## Keyboard Shortcuts for Common Operations (2024-03-27)

### Key Insights
1. **User Experience Enhancement**: Adding familiar keyboard shortcuts (like Delete for deletion) significantly improves user experience with minimal code changes.

2. **Consistent Behavior**: Ensuring that keyboard shortcuts trigger the same actions as their button counterparts maintains a consistent user interface.

3. **Mode Awareness**: Some shortcuts should be aware of the application's current mode (e.g., connection mode vs. normal mode) to prevent unintended actions.

4. **UI Context Sensitivity**: Shortcuts like Delete only make sense when a component is selected, so checks should be in place before triggering actions.

5. **Input Focus Handling**: Keyboard shortcuts should be disabled when the user is typing in text fields to avoid unintended actions.

6. **Hotkey Documentation**: It's important to document available keyboard shortcuts for users, potentially through tooltips or a help menu.

7. **Priority Hierarchy**: Some shortcuts like Play/Pause (Space) and Reset (R) should be globally available regardless of application mode, while others should be context-sensitive.

8. **Visual Indicators**: Including the keyboard shortcut in the button text (e.g., "Reset (R)") makes shortcuts discoverable without requiring separate documentation.

9. **Consistent Mapping**: Following established patterns (R for Reset, Space for Play/Pause) makes shortcuts intuitive and easier to remember. 

## Parameter Management in Method Calls (2024-03-27)

### Key Insights
1. **Positional vs. Named Arguments**: Be careful when mixing positional and named arguments, especially with methods that have many parameters. Use named arguments for clarity when there are more than 3-4 parameters.

2. **Method Signature Evolution**: As method signatures evolve over time (adding more parameters), calls to those methods should be reviewed and updated throughout the codebase.

3. **Parameter Documentation**: Add comments to method calls with many arguments to clarify what each parameter represents. This makes code more maintainable and reduces confusion.

4. **Default Parameters**: When a method has many parameters with default values, prefer named arguments for optional parameters to make the code more self-documenting and less error-prone.

5. **Parameter Order Sensitivity**: Positional arguments are order-sensitive; changing parameter order in a method signature requires updating all calls to that method. Named arguments mitigate this risk.

6. **Argument Type Checking**: Consider adding type hints and validation for method parameters to catch errors at development time rather than at runtime.

7. **Duplicate Argument Prevention**: The same parameter cannot be specified as both a positional and named argument in Python (`TypeError: got multiple values for argument`). This is a common source of errors when refactoring.

8. **Method Signature Refactoring**: When a method has many parameters, consider refactoring to use a configuration object or parameter class to simplify the interface and make it more maintainable. 

## Data Serialization and Component References (2024-03-27)

### Key Insights
1. **Stable Component Indexing**: When saving object references to a file, always use a consistent and explicit indexing scheme rather than relying on dynamic list indexing or object identity.

2. **Explicit Mapping Tables**: Maintain mapping tables between in-memory objects and their serialized representations to ensure consistent referencing, especially for graph-like structures.

3. **Scene vs. Model Consistency**: In graphical applications, the scene graph order may not match the logical model order. Never assume scene items and model components share the same ordering.

4. **Reference Integrity**: When reconstructing object relationships from serialized data, verify that all referenced objects actually exist before attempting to create connections.

5. **Error Resilience**: Include error handling when loading potentially corrupted or incompatible data files. Log warnings for invalid references rather than failing silently.

6. **Bidirectional References**: When objects reference each other (like components and connections), ensure that both sides of the relationship are properly updated or rely on constructors to handle this automatically.

7. **Versioning Considerations**: As data models evolve, maintain backward compatibility by handling different attribute names or structures in serialized data, with sensible defaults for missing attributes.

8. **Graph Serialization**: When saving graph-like structures (nodes and edges), it's most reliable to first serialize all nodes with stable IDs, then separately serialize all edges referencing those IDs. 

## UI Enhancement Lessons (2025-03-28)
1. User Interface Defaults
   - Starting with hidden panels provides a cleaner interface focused on the main content
   - Auto-opening panels only when relevant (like when selecting a component) improves UX
   - Floating panels can provide better workspace flexibility than docked panels
   - Well-positioned floating panels (relative to screen center) ensure good visibility

2. Keyboard Shortcuts
   - Hotkeys for commonly used panels improve workflow efficiency
   - Documenting hotkeys in menu items (e.g., "Show Properties Panel (P)") improves discoverability
   - Toggle behavior (show/hide) is more intuitive than separate show/hide actions
   - Hotkeys should still work regardless of simulation state for consistent experience

3. Stylesheet Management
   - QSS (Qt Style Sheets) provide powerful styling capabilities
   - Centralized stylesheet definition improves consistency across UI elements
   - Targeting specific widgets (like QDockWidget::title) allows for precise styling
   - Small visual improvements (darker title bars, centered text) can significantly enhance UI appearance

4. UI Element Sizing
   - Elements need minimum size constraints to prevent content truncation
   - Testing on different screen sizes and resolutions is important
   - Small adjustments (like dropdown width) can have meaningful impact on usability
   - Visual consistency across similar controls improves overall application appearance

5. Panel Management
   - Panels should remember position when hidden/shown
   - First-time positioning logic should be separate from general visibility toggling
   - Using desktop geometry helps ensure panels appear in sensible positions
   - Boundary checking ensures panels don't appear off-screen 

## UI Panel Auto-Resizing (2025-03-28)
Key insights from implementing auto-resizing panels:

1. Size Policy Management
   - QSizePolicy.Preferred allows widgets to expand and contract based on content size
   - Setting appropriate size policies is crucial for responsive UI behavior
   - Both the container widget and its parent dock need compatible size policies

2. Layout Margin Optimization
   - Reducing layout margins helps create more compact UI elements
   - Hierarchical layout margin management (outer vs inner layouts)
   - Strategic use of spacing provides balance between compactness and readability

3. Explicit Size Adjustment
   - Explicit calls to adjustSize() are sometimes needed to force layout recalculation
   - Widget hierarchies may require adjustment at multiple levels
   - Size adjustments should be called after content changes are complete

4. Dock Widget Configuration
   - Dock widgets need specific features enabled to support proper resizing
   - Floating docks have different resize behavior than docked panels
   - QDockWidget features control what operations are permitted on the panel

5. Widget Hierarchy Awareness
   - Size changes propagate through the widget hierarchy
   - Parent widgets need to accommodate child widget size changes
   - Layout policies at each level affect overall resizing behavior 

## Fixed Panel UI Integration (2025-03-28)
Key insights from implementing fixed panels without title bars:

1. Dock Widget Customization
   - QDockWidget.setTitleBarWidget(QWidget()) replaces the title bar with an empty widget
   - This creates a seamless integration with the main application window
   - Panels without title bars appear as permanent parts of the UI rather than movable components

2. Feature Control
   - QDockWidget.NoDockWidgetFeatures removes all interactive capabilities (floating, closing, moving)
   - This prevents accidental panel closure or repositioning
   - Fixed panels provide a more stable, consistent user experience
   - Selective feature enabling/disabling can create hybrid behaviors when needed

3. Visual Hierarchy
   - Removing title bars from fixed panels while keeping them on optional panels creates a visual hierarchy
   - Users can visually distinguish between permanent UI elements and supplementary panels
   - This establishes a clear information architecture in the application UI

4. Application Frame Design
   - Fixed panels create a "frame" around the central workspace
   - This design pattern is common in professional tools and creative applications
   - The pattern creates a consistent application boundary with tool access always in the same location

5. Widget Customization Balance
   - Not all panels should be fixed - floating panels are valuable for temporary properties/settings
   - A mixed approach with some fixed and some floating panels provides the best user experience
   - Only panels that provide core functionality should be fixed in the interface 

## Application Launch Flow (2025-03-28)
Key insights from implementing a title screen and custom application startup sequence:

1. Sequential UI Loading
   - QApplication instance should be created first and shared across all windows
   - Showing windows in sequence requires careful signal/slot connections
   - The destroyed signal can be used to trigger showing subsequent windows
   - Using connect() to link window lifecycle events creates clean transitions

2. Frameless Window Design
   - Qt.FramelessWindowHint flag creates borderless windows for splash screens
   - Frameless windows require custom position handling (no default window manager decorations)
   - Setting zero content margins in layouts ensures edge-to-edge image display
   - Fixed window sizing prevents unexpected resizing of splash content

3. Image-Based UI Elements
   - QPixmap provides efficient display of static images in Qt
   - Error handling for missing images is essential for robustness
   - Setting fallback UI for missing resources improves reliability
   - Preserving native image resolution maintains visual quality

4. Window Positioning
   - Calculating screen dimensions via QApplication.desktop().screenGeometry()
   - Center positioning requires accounting for both screen and window size
   - Using integer division for coordinates prevents pixel offset issues
   - Different monitors may have different DPI settings requiring handling

5. Event Handling for User Input
   - KeyPressEvent override provides custom keyboard interaction
   - Supporting multiple keys (Enter, Space, Escape) improves user experience
   - Always call the parent class implementation for unhandled events
   - Using event.key() with Qt.Key_* constants ensures cross-platform compatibility 

## Signal-Slot Patterns for Window Transitions (2025-03-28)
Key insights from implementing reliable window transitions in Qt applications:

1. Custom Signal Definition
   - PyQt's signal-slot mechanism is more reliable than relying on built-in widget lifecycle signals
   - Defining custom signals (pyqtSignal) provides explicit control over transition timing
   - Signal emission can be placed at the exact point in code flow where the transition should occur
   - Custom signals make the intent clearer than repurposing built-in signals like destroyed

2. Signal Emission Timing
   - Emit signals before performing destructive operations like window.close()
   - Qt's destroyed signal is intended for cleanup operations, not for UI flow control
   - The close() method might disrupt signal propagation if the signal handler is connected to the destroyed signal
   - Emitting signals before closing ensures the connected slots are executed properly

3. Object Creation Order
   - Create target windows (destinations) before creating source windows (origins)
   - This ensures signal connections can be established before any signals might be emitted
   - Follow the pattern: create destination → connect signals → show origin
   - Consistent object creation ordering prevents race conditions in the UI flow

4. Launch Sequence Design
   - Separate window creation from window display for better control
   - Handle transitions as explicit events rather than side effects
   - Create a clear visual indication of the application's entry point
   - Design for both normal flow and edge cases (like rapid key presses)

5. Testing for Window Transitions
   - Test all possible transition triggers (different keys, window close button, etc.)
   - Verify that resources are properly cleaned up after transitions
   - Check that the application responds correctly to rapid or repeated transition requests
   - Ensure transition behavior is consistent across different platforms 

## Window Positioning Consistency (2025-03-28)
Key insights from implementing consistent window positioning:

1. Consistent User Experience
   - All application windows should follow the same positioning principles
   - Main windows and title screens both benefit from screen centering
   - Centered windows provide a professional appearance across different screen sizes
   - Window positioning is an often overlooked but important aspect of UX

2. Adaptive Positioning Techniques
   - Using screen geometry to calculate center points works across different monitors
   - QApplication.desktop().screenGeometry() provides the current screen dimensions
   - Integer division prevents pixel alignment issues from floating-point calculations
   - Consistent positioning techniques should be applied throughout the application

3. Window Size Considerations
   - For accurate centering, window geometry must be retrieved after window size is set
   - Setting default window sizes before centering ensures proper placement
   - Different window types (frameless, normal) should maintain consistent positioning
   - Consistent visual flow from title screen to main application enhances user experience

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
   - Window positioning code should work consistently across operating systems
   - Qt's platform-independent approach helps ensure consistent behavior
   - Screen DPI variations are handled properly through Qt's screen geometry functions
   - Simple positioning algorithms (like centering) work well across different platforms

5. Sequential Window Presentation
   - When transitioning between windows, consistent positioning creates a smoother experience
   - Users perceive the application as more professional when windows appear in predictable locations
   - Avoid jarring transitions where windows jump to different screen positions
   - Maintain spatial consistency throughout the application lifecycle 

## UI Onboarding and Guidance (2025-03-29)
Key insights from implementing welcome text and user guidance:

1. Contextual Instruction
   - In-context guidance (like welcome text in the work area) is more effective than separate instructions
   - Simple, clear directives like "Build Here" communicate the expected action directly
   - Minimal text encourages exploration while providing just enough direction
   - Placing instructions in the relevant work area creates spatial association with the task

2. Progressive Disclosure
   - Automatically removing guidance text after first action prevents information overload
   - Users only need initial direction and can then explore the interface more naturally
   - Temporary guidance doesn't clutter the interface for experienced users
   - The timing of guidance disappearance provides feedback that the user is making progress

3. Visual Styling Considerations
   - Semi-transparent text ensures guidance is noticeable without dominating the interface
   - Larger font size increases visibility while conveying importance
   - Bold text styling helps differentiate guidance from regular interface elements
   - Proper positioning in the center of the work area ensures the guidance is seen before interaction begins

4. Technical Implementation
   - Using a QGraphicsTextItem allows for flexible positioning within the scene
   - Delayed positioning (with QTimer.singleShot) ensures the view is fully initialized before calculating center position
   - Checking if text exists and is visible prevents errors if components are added after text is removed
   - Component-type filtering prevents decorative components from triggering guidance removal

5. Empty State Design
   - The initial "empty" state of an application can be confusing without proper guidance
   - Welcome text transforms an empty canvas into an instruction
   - First-use experience significantly impacts user perception of application complexity
   - Simple guidance can reduce the intimidation factor of a blank workspace
   - First-use experience significantly impacts user perception of application complexity
   - Simple guidance can reduce the intimidation factor of a blank workspace 

## Property Interface Consistency Across Component Types (2025-03-29)
When implementing related properties across different component types:

1. Property Pattern Consistency
   - Similar properties should have consistent naming across component types
   - Use the same default values and behavior patterns for conceptually related properties
   - Example: `auto_charging` in generators and `auto_charge_batteries` in grid imports follow the same pattern

2. UI Control Standardization
   - Use the same UI control types for similar properties across components
   - Apply consistent styling, colors, and button states (green/red for ON/OFF toggles)
   - Maintain consistent property label naming in the properties panel
   - This reduces user learning curve when interacting with different components

3. Simulation Logic Cohesion
   - Properties that influence the same simulation aspects should work consistently
   - Battery charging behavior is controlled the same way whether from generators or grid imports
   - Preserve the same priority order and calculation flow in the simulation engine
   - Consistent handling in the simulation engine's step-by-step process

4. Serialization Standardization
   - Include all similar properties in component serialization with consistent formatting
   - Handle backward compatibility the same way for all components
   - Default to sensible values when properties are missing from saved files
   - Example: Both component types default to `True` for auto-charging when not specified

5. Documentation and Naming
   - Use descriptive, self-explanatory property names
   - Keep naming consistent with the domain terminology
   - Document properties similarly across component types
   - Maintain consistent commenting style in property declarations

6. Migration Strategy
   - When adding properties to one component type, consider if other types need similar properties
   - Plan for cross-component consistency from the beginning of feature implementation
   - Document changes to component properties in history logs with consistent detail 

## Multi-Stage Title Screen System (2024-07-06)
- The application now uses a three-stage title screen approach:
  * First shows the WBR title screen (using WBRtitle.png)
  * Then transitions to the Augur title screen (using augurtitle.png)
  * Then transitions to the original title screen
  * Finally transitions to the main application window
- Title screens use PyQt5's signal/slot mechanism for transitions:
  * WBRTitleScreen emits transition_to_next signal to show AugurTitleScreen
  * AugurTitleScreen emits transition_to_next signal to show TitleScreen
  * TitleScreen emits transition_to_main signal to show main application window
- All screens share common functionality:
  * Frameless window design
  * Centered position on screen
  * Key press handling (Enter/Space/Escape to advance)
  * Image display with fallback text
- This approach demonstrates the flexibility of the design to support a sequence of any number of introductory screens

- When adding accumulated properties to components, ensure they are reset in the reset_simulation method

# Lessons Learned

## Component System
- Components inherit from ComponentBase
- Each component type has its own class file in src/components/
- Components have a visual representation in the paint method
- Components can have properties that affect simulation behavior
- Functional components are stored in the main_window.components list
- Decorative components are not added to components list (they don't affect network connectivity)

## Adding New Components
To add a new component:
1. Create a new class file in src/components/
2. Import the component in main_window.py
3. Add a button to place the component
4. Add handling in add_component method

## UI System
- Uses PyQt5 for UI components
- Main window organizes dockable panels
- Component buttons are in the left panel
- Properties are displayed in a floating panel
- Simulation controls are at the bottom

## Revenue Calculation System
- Revenue can come from multiple sources (loads, grid exports, cloud workloads)
- All revenue sources are accumulated into the gross_revenue_data array in SimulationEngine
- Components track their own accumulated_revenue property
- Revenue calculation happens in the update_simulation method based on energy consumed
- The system supports different revenue models (per kWh, per resource, bulk PPA)
- CloudWorkloadComponent demonstrates how to implement cross-component revenue calculations
- Revenue calculations are time-step aware and properly handle simulation speed changes
- Components with accumulated values must be reset in the reset_simulation method to ensure proper visual display 

## QGraphicsView Overlays
- To add a fixed overlay on top of a QGraphicsView:
  - Create a QLabel as a child of the QGraphicsView
  - Use setAttribute(Qt.WA_TransparentForMouseEvents) to make it click-through
  - Handle the QGraphicsView's resize events to reposition the overlay
  - Be careful not to override the existing resize behavior by saving/calling the original implementation 

## PyQt5 UI Styling (2025-04-01)
1. **QSlider Styling**:
   - QSlider has multiple sub-elements that can be styled independently:
     * `QSlider::groove` - The entire track the handle moves along
     * `QSlider::sub-page` - The portion of the track between minimum value and handle
     * `QSlider::add-page` - The portion of the track between handle and maximum value
     * `QSlider::handle` - The part that users can drag
   - Visual progress indication can be created by styling the `sub-page` differently from the `groove`
   - Example: `QSlider::sub-page:horizontal { background: rgb(255, 215, 0); height: 8px; border-radius: 4px; }`
   - Border radius should be consistent between groove and sub-page to maintain smooth appearance
   - The same styling approach works for both horizontal and vertical sliders

2. **Style Consistency**:
   - UI components should maintain consistent styling across the application
   - Color schemes should be reused where appropriate (e.g., using connection colors for related UI elements)
   - Visual feedback should be consistent (progress indicators, selections, etc.)
   - Consider creating style constants or variables for frequently used colors/styles

3. **QStyleSheet Best Practices**:
   - Keep related style rules grouped in a single stylesheet string
   - Be specific with selectors to avoid unintended style application
   - Use consistent formatting for readability
   - Document style choices, especially for complex widgets 

## Multi-Component Selection and Deletion (2025-04-03)
1. Selection Handling
   - The application supports multi-component selection using Qt's standard selection mechanism
   - The scene.selectedItems() method returns all currently selected items
   - Selected items must be filtered to only include components with the needed properties
   - Each component has an isSelected() method from QGraphicsItem that can be checked

2. Multiple Component Operations
   - Operations like deletion need to handle both single and multiple selections
   - When deleting multiple components, each component must be processed individually
   - Error handling must be robust to handle components that may not be in certain lists
   - Always check if an item is in a collection before removing it to avoid ValueErrors

3. Component Management
   - The main_window.components list tracks only functional components, not decorative ones
   - Different component types require different cleanup procedures
   - Connections between components must be properly cleaned up when components are deleted
   - The scene and the components list must stay in sync during deletion operations

4. UI State Management
   - After deleting components, the properties panel should be updated or hidden
   - The simulation state needs to be updated after component deletion
   - Error handling should be comprehensive to avoid crashes during bulk operations
   - The order of operations is important: first remove connections, then components from scene, then from lists 

## Dynamic Data Visualization in Historian (2024-07-08)
Key insights from implementing a dynamic multi-series chart system:

1. Data-Driven Visualization
   - The chart system now automatically adapts to whatever data is present in the historian
   - No hardcoded series names or references, everything is generated from the dictionary keys
   - New data series are automatically detected and visualized without code changes
   - This allows for easy extension of the historian with additional metrics

2. Consistent Visual Language
   - Predefined color mapping ensures that common data types always use the same colors
   - Automatic color generation for new data types uses a golden ratio approach for visual distinction
   - All lines share consistent styling (shadow effects, line width, alpha) for visual cohesion
   - Human-readable labels are automatically generated from data keys (e.g., 'total_generation' → 'Total Generation')

3. Resource Management
   - Lines are created only when needed and stored in a dictionary for reuse
   - Memory usage scales linearly with the number of data series
   - Color assignments are cached to ensure consistent colors across sessions
   - The system efficiently updates only what has changed rather than redrawing everything

4. Backward Compatibility
   - The new system maintains perfect compatibility with existing code that expects 'total_generation'
   - No changes needed to the simulation engine or other components that produce historian data
   - Existing save files will load and display correctly with the new visualization system
   - Gradual transition path from single-line to multi-line visualization 

Apr 05, 2024: When implementing time-based simulations with discrete steps, it's critical to process the current time step BEFORE incrementing to the next time step. This ensures that the initial state (t=0) is properly calculated and not skipped. This pattern applies to both the main simulation loop and any auxiliary functions like autocomplete that process multiple time steps. In our case, the simulation was incrementing first, then processing, which caused it to always skip time step 0. 

## Extending the Historian with New Data Series (2024-07-08)
Key insights from adding new data series to the historian:

1. Modular Data Addition
   - Adding a new data series to the historian is a simple two-step process:
     * Initialize the data array in the historian dictionary
     * Add code to update the array at each time step
   - No visualization code changes are needed due to the dynamic chart system
   - The chart automatically detects and displays the new data series

2. Data Consistency
   - All data arrays in the historian should have the same length (8761 entries for hourly data over a year)
   - Initialize with zeros to ensure proper data type and prevent null values
   - Ensure proper bounds checking when accessing array elements
   - Use the same naming convention for related data series

3. Performance Considerations
   - Only record data when within the valid index range
   - Store time series data efficiently to minimize memory usage
   - Adding more data series has minimal performance impact as they share the same update cycle
   - The historian provides an efficient way to track system metrics over time 

## Grid Import/Export Data Tracking (2024-07-08)
Key insights from implementing grid import/export tracking in the historian:

1. Comprehensive System Monitoring
   - Tracking both generation/load and grid import/export provides a complete picture of power flow
   - Grid transactions represent the system's interaction with the external world
   - Import/export data helps analyze system self-sufficiency and external dependencies
   - These metrics provide key indicators for optimizing power system design

2. Data Collection Timing
   - Grid import/export values are calculated during each simulation timestep
   - Recording happens at the same point as other historian data (generation, load)
   - Using the same array length (8761) maintains consistency across all data series
   - Collecting data at each simulation step ensures high-fidelity historical record

3. Color Coordination
   - The dynamic chart system automatically assigns appropriate colors to each data series
   - Grid import receives purple to match the grid import component color
   - Grid export receives amber to match the grid export component color
   - Color coordination helps users intuitively connect UI elements with chart data

4. Simulation Engine Integration
   - The import/export values are already calculated as part of the simulation logic
   - Adding historian recording required minimal changes to existing code
   - No impact on simulation performance or accuracy since values were already computed
   - The dynamic historian system demonstrates the benefits of loosely coupled design 

## Chart Visualization Controls (2024-07-08)
Key insights from implementing toggle controls for data series in the historian chart:

1. Interactive Data Visualization
   - Interactive controls greatly enhance chart usability when dealing with multiple data series
   - Toggle buttons allow users to focus on specific metrics by hiding irrelevant ones
   - The ability to select which series to display helps identify correlations between specific metrics
   - Control placement (left side of chart) follows standard UI conventions for toolbars/controls

2. Visual Consistency
   - Matching button colors to their corresponding chart lines creates intuitive visual connection
   - Maintaining the same naming convention between buttons and legend entries reduces cognitive load
   - Using checkable buttons with clear visual states (colored when visible, gray when hidden) provides clear feedback
   - Faded legend entries for hidden series maintain context while clearly indicating what's not being displayed

3. Dynamic UI Generation
   - Generating UI controls dynamically based on available data follows the data-driven approach
   - Controls are created on-demand as new data series appear in the historian
   - This avoids hardcoding assumptions about what data will be available
   - The scroll area ensures the UI remains usable even with many data series

4. Performance Optimization
   - Focusing y-axis scaling only on visible series improves data visualization
   - Hiding series doesn't delete the data, allowing quick toggling without data loss
   - The chart still maintains all lines but simply toggles their visibility property
   - This approach is more efficient than recreating lines when toggling visibility

5. Extensibility
   - The toggle control system works with any number of data series
   - New data metrics can be added to the historian without UI modifications
   - The unified approach to toggle controls ensures consistent behavior across all data types
   - This pattern can be extended to other visualization features like line style or thickness controls 

## Dual Y-Axis Chart Visualization (2024-07-08)
Key insights from implementing dual y-axes in the historian chart:

1. Data Type Separation
   - Using separate y-axes allows visualization of data with different units and scales
   - Power measurements (kW) and financial data ($) can be displayed simultaneously without scale conflicts
   - Separating axes prevents one data type from visually dominating the chart when scales differ significantly
   - Consistent color-coding between axis, line, and button creates intuitive association

2. Axis Management
   - Matplotlib's twinx() method creates a second y-axis that shares the same x-axis
   - Each axis needs independent styling (colors, labels, tick parameters)
   - Programmatically choosing which axis to plot on based on data type ensures consistency
   - Dynamic visibility control for the secondary axis prevents cluttered UI when not needed

3. Interface Organization
   - Visual separation in the control panel (using horizontal lines) creates clear data categories
   - Adding unit indicators ([$]) to button labels reduces confusion about which axis applies
   - Consistent positioning of related controls (cumulative revenue always at bottom) aids discoverability
   - Secondary y-axis placement (right side) follows visualization conventions

4. Scale Independence
   - Each axis scales independently based on its visible data series
   - Automatic hiding of unused axes maintains clean presentation
   - Independent max value tracking ensures optimal visualization of each data type
   - Setting appropriate padding (10% headroom) improves readability for both axes

5. Extensible Design
   - The secondary_axis_series list allows easy addition of new financial metrics in the future
   - Categories of data (power vs. financial) are clearly defined for future expansion
   - Button creation and management are separated by data type category
   - The system handles dynamic addition of new data series while maintaining proper categorization 

## Revenue Calculation Lessons (2024-07-08)
- When calculating revenue from exports, it's important to track how much each individual component exports rather than applying the total export amount to each component. This prevents double-counting in scenarios with multiple export connections.
- The simulation engine should maintain separate accounting for each component's contribution to system-level values like grid_export, especially when these values are used for subsequent calculations like revenue. 

## Variable Initialization and Conditional Blocks (2024-07-08)
- Always initialize variables before they might be used, even if initialization seems unnecessary in some code paths
- When a variable is used in multiple code paths, initialize it outside conditional blocks to ensure it's always available
- Be especially careful with dictionaries or collections that are referenced in financial or revenue calculations
- Proper initialization prevents "referenced before assignment" errors that can crash the application 

## Grid Export Pricing Prioritization (2025-04-05)
Key insights from implementing grid export prioritization:

1. Export Priority Logic
   - When multiple grid export components exist, they should be prioritized by price to maximize revenue
   - Higher priced export options should receive surplus power first before lower priced options
   - This follows economic principles of optimizing value from available resources
   - The simulation engine's "Eighth Pass" handles surplus power after all other allocations are complete

2. Component Sorting in Simulation
   - List comprehensions efficiently collect components of a specific type from the scene
   - Python's sort() method with a key function and reverse flag provides flexible sorting
   - Prioritization uses bulk_ppa_price attribute in descending order (highest to lowest)
   - This approach maintains the separation between component definition and simulation logic

3. Dictionary Initialization Safety
   - Dictionaries should be initialized before any conditional logic that might reference them
   - The component_exports dictionary needs to exist even if there's no surplus power to export
   - This prevents "referenced before assignment" errors when the code path changes
   - Defensive programming helps prevent runtime errors in complex simulation logic

4. Revenue Optimization
   - Grid exports can be a significant revenue source in power systems
   - Prioritizing exports by price directly impacts the financial performance of the system
   - This approach simulates how real power systems prioritize sales to highest-paying markets first
   - The system now correctly models economic dispatch principles for exports 

## UI Menu Organization (2024-07-09)
1. Menu Structuring Best Practices
   - Related actions should be grouped under a common menu
   - Actions like "New", "Save", and "Load" are naturally grouped under a "Model" or "File" menu
   - Using QToolButton with a QMenu provides a clean, compact toolbar appearance
   - QToolButton's InstantPopup mode improves usability by showing menu on button click

2. PyQt Menu Implementation Pattern
   - Create menu object (QMenu)
   - Add actions to menu
   - Create QToolButton to hold menu
   - Set button text and menu
   - Configure popup mode
   - Add button to toolbar

3. Menu Organization Benefits
   - Reduces toolbar clutter by grouping related actions
   - Creates a more standard application interface familiar to users
   - Improves scalability - new related actions can be added to existing menus
   - Provides clearer organization of application functions

## 2024-07-10: Multi-Series Chart Scaling Best Practices
When implementing charts with multiple data series that can be toggled on/off:

1. Always scale axes based on ALL currently visible series, not just the most recently toggled series
   - This prevents confusing rescaling when toggling between series with different value ranges
   - Users expect the chart to show the full range of all visible data

2. When toggling visibility:
   - Recalculate maximum values across all visible series
   - Apply scaling to show the highest values properly
   - Consider all visible series on each axis independently

3. For multi-axis charts:
   - Each axis should scale independently based on its own visible series
   - When a series is toggled on one axis, only that axis should be affected
   - Maintain consistent behavior between manual toggling and programmatic updates

4. Implementation approach:
   - Maintain a dictionary tracking visibility state for all series
   - When toggling, iterate through all series checking visibility
   - Find maximum value across all visible series for each axis
   - Apply appropriate scaling with headroom (e.g., max * 1.1)

## PyQt Timer Implementation (2024-08-05)
1. Qt Timer Usage
   - QTimer provides a reliable way to implement timed events in PyQt applications
   - Single-shot timers (setSingleShot(True)) are ideal for one-time transitions
   - Connecting timer.timeout signal to a method provides clean event handling
   - Timers can be safely started in the showEvent method to ensure proper initialization

2. Modal Screen Sequencing
   - Auto-transition timers enable smooth progression through splash/title screens
   - Manual keyboard transitions can safely coexist with automatic timers
   - Stopping timers on manual transitions prevents potential race conditions
   - The signal/slot mechanism in Qt makes screen transitions clean and decoupled

3. User Experience Improvements
   - Auto-transitions provide fallback behavior for users who don't interact
   - 3-second duration balances visibility needs with maintaining application flow
   - Implementing both manual and automatic transitions improves accessibility
   - Frameless windows with timed transitions create a professional splash screen experience

## Decorative Component Consistency (2024-07-15)
1. Complete Validation Chain
   - Decorative components need to be consistently handled at all connection points
   - Both local component click handlers and central connection manager must enforce the same rules
   - All decorative components should be treated identically in connection operations
   - Adding new decorative components requires updating all relevant validation points

2. Connection Validation Layers
   - The system has multiple layers of connection validation:
     * Component-level mousePressEvent handlers can prevent click signals
     * ConnectionManager.handle_connection_click filters components by type
     * ConnectionManager.handle_sever_connection filters components by type
     * Connection validation rules check compatibility of connected components
   - All layers must be kept in sync when adding new component types
   - Each validation layer serves a different purpose and should be comprehensive

3. Component Type Consistency
   - Decorative components (like Bush, Tree, Pond, Houses, Factory, TraditionalDataCenter, DistributionPole)
     should be handled consistently throughout the codebase
   - When adding new decorative components, all connection handling code must be updated
   - Type checking in instanceof statements needs to include all relevant component types
   - Special handling for component types should be centralized when possible

## Adding New Components
To add a new component:
1. Create a new class file in src/components/
2. Import the component in main_window.py
3. Add a button to place the component
4. Add handling in add_component method

## UI Initialization Extraction (2024-07-10)
Key insights from extracting UI initialization code:

1. **Static Initialization Pattern**
   - Using a static method for UI initialization provides a clean way to extract initialization logic
   - The static method takes the main window instance as a parameter and initializes its UI elements
   - This approach maintains full compatibility with existing code without changing method signatures
   - No state needs to be maintained in the initializer class, making it stateless and simpler

2. **Reference Management**
   - All UI element references (buttons, sliders, panels) must still be assigned to the main window instance
   - Instead of using `self.button = ...`, we use `main_window.button = ...` in the static method
   - This ensures that the main window can still access all UI elements after initialization
   - Component event handlers still reference the main window instance for callbacks

3. **Dependency Handling**
   - The UI initializer requires access to several classes defined in the main window:
     * TiledBackgroundWidget
     * AnalyticsPanel
   - Either these classes must be accessible in the initializer's scope or explicitly passed in

4. **Import Considerations**
   - The UI initializer imports the same UI-related modules as the main window
   - This creates some duplication but is cleaner than trying to share imports
   - The initializer only imports what it needs for UI creation, not for simulation logic

5. **Refactoring Strategy**
   - Extracted the complete method without changing any functionality
   - Replaced all references to `self` with references to the passed main window parameter
   - Updated the main window to import and use the new initializer
   - This minimal-change approach ensures behavioral consistency before and after refactoring

6. **Dependency Handling Strategies**
   - When extracting UI code, be aware of dependencies on custom widget classes
   - Three options for handling dependencies:
     * Import the dependent classes directly (if they're in separate modules)
     * Re-implement the dependent classes in the extracted module (for simple widgets)
     * Access the classes through the main_window parameter (less ideal, creates tight coupling)
   - Re-implementing simple widget classes (like TiledBackgroundWidget) in the extracted module 
     provides the cleanest separation while avoiding circular imports
   - For more complex dependencies like AnalyticsPanel, direct imports are preferable
   - Proper dependency management is crucial for successful UI code extraction

## Component Creation Extraction (2024-07-08)

### Key Insights
1. **Separation of Creation Logic**: Extracting component creation into a dedicated class improves code organization and maintainability by separating the "what" (UI commands) from the "how" (component instantiation).

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**: Using the main window as a constructor parameter allows the ComponentAdder to access all necessary resources (scene, components list, particle system) without duplicating logic.

3. **Invisible Refactoring**: The extraction was performed in a way that's completely invisible to the rest of the application - the behavior is identical before and after the change.

4. **Self-Contained Logic**: The component adder encapsulates all logic related to component creation, including special handling for decorative vs. functional components and welcome text visibility.

5. **Delegator Pattern**: The main window now acts as a delegator, forwarding component creation requests to the specialized ComponentAdder class while maintaining the same method signature.

6. **Code Organization**: Moving the substantial component creation logic (17 component types) out of the main window significantly reduces its complexity and improves readability.

7. **Modular Architecture**: This extraction follows the pattern established with previous extractions (SimulationEngine, ConnectionManager, etc.) to create a more modular and maintainable architecture.

## KeyHandler Implementation (2024-07-07)
Key insights from extracting the keyboard event handling:

1. Delegation Pattern
   - Main window can delegate key events to a specialized handler class
   - The handler class can maintain its own logic while still accessing main window state
   - This creates cleaner separation of concerns without disrupting API compatibility
   - Event handling becomes more maintainable when isolated from UI rendering

2. Event Flow Control
   - The handler returns boolean values to indicate whether events were handled
   - This allows the main window to decide whether to pass events to the parent class
   - Preserves the exact same event propagation behavior as the original implementation
   - Maintains complete backward compatibility with existing key handling

3. State Access
   - KeyHandler needs access to main window state but doesn't need to modify the main window class
   - This is achieved by passing a reference to the main window in the constructor
   - The handler can then access all necessary properties and methods via this reference
   - No changes to method signatures or state management are required

4. Focused Responsibility
   - KeyHandler has a single, clear responsibility: processing keyboard input
   - This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain
   - Future key binding changes can be made in one place without affecting the main window
   - The main_window.py file becomes less cluttered and more focused on UI management

5. Conditional Event Processing
   - The handler preserves all context-specific logic (e.g., ignoring keys when editing text)
   - Mode awareness is maintained (e.g., different actions based on connection mode)
   - The handler correctly respects the state of UI controls (enabled/disabled)
   - This demonstrates that complex conditional logic can be extracted without simplification

## Custom Profile Implementation (2024-04-08)
Key insights from implementing custom profiles for solar panels:

1. Consistent Feature Implementation
   - When implementing similar features across different component types, maintaining consistent interfaces and behavior is crucial
   - Custom profiles in solar panels follow the same pattern as in load components
   - This includes CSV loading, profile display, and time-based data handling
   - Users benefit from consistent mental models when similar features work the same way

2. Component State Serialization
   - For features like custom profiles, both the data and metadata need to be serialized
   - Saving both `custom_profile` (the data array) and `profile_name` (visual identification)
   - ModelManager needs to handle loading these properties with backward compatibility
   - Including profile data in component.serialize() ensures the data persists across save/load cycles

3. UI Property Management
   - Dynamic UI elements (like the "Load Profile" button) should appear/disappear based on the selected mode
   - Providing visual feedback of loaded profiles through an info label improves user experience
   - Complex properties benefit from composite UI components (mode selector + load button in a horizontal layout)
   - Maintaining UI state across component selection/deselection cycles ensures consistent user experience

4. Calculation Logic Patterns
   - Renewable components (like solar panels) use capacity factors to calculate actual output
   - Time-based simulation requires handling wrap-around for profiles shorter than the simulation period
   - Current time step needs to be obtained from the simulation engine in a consistent way
   - Cached output values (last_output) help with debugging and visual display

5. Consolidated Profile Loading Logic
   - Both load components and solar panels use the same _load_custom_profile method in PropertiesManager
   - This promotes code reuse and ensures consistent handling of CSV files
   - New component types that need profile loading can leverage the same infrastructure
   - Future improvements to profile loading will automatically benefit all components

## Component Feature Replication (2024-04-08)
Key insights from implementing the same feature across multiple component types:

1. Code Duplication vs. Inheritance
   - When implementing identical features in similar components, consider inheritance or composition
   - For WindTurbineComponent and SolarPanelComponent, we duplicated the custom profile functionality
   - A future refactoring could extract this to a shared base class or mixin
   - The current approach provides flexibility at the cost of some duplication

2. Consistent Implementation Pattern
   - Following the same implementation pattern across component types:
     * Same attribute names (custom_profile, profile_name)
     * Same UI elements (mode selector, load button, profile info label)
     * Same serialization approach
     * Same engine integration points
   - This consistency makes the codebase more maintainable and predictable

3. UI Behavior Standardization
   - Users expect the same UI behavior across similar components
   - Maintaining identical interaction patterns reinforces usability
   - Consistent property panel layouts across similar component types
   - Standardized button behavior and naming conventions

4. System-Wide Integration
   - Multiple systems must be updated for each feature addition:
     * Component class (attributes and methods)
     * Properties manager (UI elements and event handlers)
     * Model manager (serialization and deserialization)
     * Simulation engine (integration with calculation logic)
     * Documentation (history and lessons)
   - Checklist-based approach ensures complete implementation across all systems

5. Validation and Testing
   - Similar features should be tested in a similar way
   - Testing one component can guide testing of the second implementation
   - Complex features like custom profiles need testing for various edge cases:
     * Empty files
     * Files with different number of entries (fewer or more than 8760)
     * Invalid data values
     * Mode switching with and without loaded profiles

2023-04-08: The particle system in the UI is a versatile component that can be used for multiple different visual effects. It can handle both temporary effects (component placement) and continuous effects (generator smoke during simulation). The ParticleSystem class can be easily extended to support different types of particles with custom behaviors by adding parameters to the Particle class constructor and implementing specialized particle creation methods.

## 2024-07-08: Button Styling in PyQt5
- You can add interactive states (hover, pressed) to buttons using QPushButton's CSS pseudo-selectors
- The main states that can be styled are:
  * Default state: `QPushButton { ... }`
  * Hover state: `QPushButton:hover { ... }`
  * Pressed state: `QPushButton:pressed { ... }`
- When using the pressed state, it's helpful to adjust padding to compensate for border width changes
  * For example, if border width increases from 1px to 2px, reduce padding by 1px
  * This prevents the button content from appearing to "jump" when pressed
- Multi-line string literals (""" """) are helpful for complex CSS styling with multiple selectors
- A common pattern for good visual feedback:
  * Make buttons slightly lighter on hover
  * Make buttons slightly darker with a thicker border when pressed

## Revenue Popup System Implementation (2024-07-07)
Key insights from implementing the revenue popup visual feedback:

1. **Extending the Particle System**
   - The existing ParticleSystem provides a robust foundation for visual effects
   - Adding a new RevenueParticle class leverages the existing animation infrastructure
   - Using QGraphicsTextItem instead of QGraphicsEllipseItem allows for text-based particles
   - HTML formatting in particles enables rich styling (background, text color, padding)

2. **Revenue Milestone Detection**
   - Tracking previous_revenue allows components to detect threshold crossings
   - Integer division (dividing by 1000) efficiently detects $1,000 increments
   - Comparing previous and current "thousands" detects multiple increments in one step
   - This approach works properly even with large revenue jumps during autocomplete

3. **Visual Feedback Timing**
   - The update() method provides a consistent hook for milestone checks
   - Revenue popups appear only during active simulation or autocomplete
   - Checking simulation state prevents unwanted popups during scrubbing or editing
   - Creating multiple popups when multiple milestones are crossed provides accurate feedback

4. **Component-Scene-Application Integration**
   - Components can access the parent window through the scene() → parent() chain
   - This provides access to shared systems like the particle_system
   - Clean architectural boundaries are maintained despite the cross-layer communication
   - Multiple safety checks prevent errors when components are not properly in a scene

5. **Serialization Considerations**
   - Adding previous_revenue to the serialized state preserves milestone tracking between sessions
   - This prevents duplicate popups when loading a saved scenario
   - The serialization process adapts automatically to new component properties

## Financial Data Tracking System (2024-07-07)
Key insights from implementing the cost tracking system for grid import components:

1. Parallel Data Structures
   - Revenue and cost tracking follow identical patterns in component properties, simulation engine, and historian
   - Using parallel attributes (accumulated_revenue/accumulated_cost, gross_revenue_data/gross_cost_data) maintains code symmetry
   - This pattern allows easy addition of new financial metrics in the future
   - Consistent naming conventions make code more readable and predictable

2. Time Series Data Management
   - The historian object stores time series data for multiple metrics
   - Adding a new metric requires updates in multiple places:
     * Initialize arrays in the SimulationEngine constructor
     * Add to reset_historian method
     * Update the time-based calculations in update_simulation
     * Add to appropriate chart rendering in the UI

3. UI Integration Points
   - The AnalyticsPanel uses a secondary Y-axis for financial metrics
   - When adding a new financial metric:
     * Update the chart axis labels to be inclusive of all metrics (e.g., "Amount ($)" instead of "Revenue ($)")
     * Add a new line with distinctive color in the chart
     * Update the legend to include the new metric
     * Handle auto-scaling to accommodate both metrics

4. Component-Level Accounting
   - Tracking accumulated_cost at the component level enables component-specific financial analysis
   - The same metric is aggregated at the system level for overall financial tracking
   - This multi-level approach provides both detailed and system-level insights
   - The component's paint method can display its own accumulated cost for user visibility

5. Consistent Visual Representation
   - Financial data is represented in the UI with consistent formatting
   - Dollar amounts use the same precision (2 decimal places)
   - Charts use distinctive colors to differentiate between revenue and cost
   - The historian manager's toggle buttons follow the same color scheme as the charts

These patterns establish a framework for tracking any financial or cumulative metric across the simulation timeline.

## Economic Dispatching in Power System Simulation (2024-07-07)
Key insights from implementing economic dispatching for grid imports:

1. Consistent Economic Optimization Pattern
   - Both grid imports and exports now follow the same pattern of economic optimization
   - Imports use ascending cost sorting (cheapest first) while exports use descending price sorting (highest price first)
   - This creates a symmetrical approach to buying and selling power in the simulation
   - The pattern matches real-world energy market optimization strategies

2. Collection and Sorting Implementation
   - Collecting all components of a specific type using list comprehension: `[item for item in scene.items() if isinstance(item, SpecificType)]`
   - Sorting based on a property using lambda function: `components.sort(key=lambda x: x.property_name, [reverse=True/False])`
   - Allows for clean, readable code that's easy to maintain and extend
   - Pattern can be applied to any component type that needs prioritization by a numeric property

3. Decoupling Component Collection from Processing
   - Previous implementation interleaved collection and processing of grid import components
   - New approach separates component collection, sorting, and processing into distinct steps
   - This separation improves code clarity and maintainability
   - Makes it easier to implement additional sorting criteria in the future

4. Simulation Pass Structure
   - Each simulation pass handles a specific aspect of the power system
   - Pass ordering creates a clear priority sequence (local generation → batteries → imports → exports)
   - Within each pass, further prioritization can be implemented (e.g., cost-based ordering)
   - This hierarchical approach mirrors real-world power system operations

5. User Interface Implications
   - The cost per kWh setting in grid import properties now has direct impact on dispatch order
   - Multiple grid import components with different costs can be used to model tiered pricing
   - Users can now experiment with different cost structures to optimize system economics
   - Visual feedback through the accumulated cost display shows the impact of dispatch decisions

## Visual Feedback for Financial Transactions (2024-07-10)
Key insights from implementing cost particle effects alongside revenue particles:

1. Symmetrical User Experience
   - Applying consistent visual patterns for opposite actions (earning vs. spending) creates intuitive user experience
   - Using color coding (green for revenue, red for cost) follows established financial conventions
   - Maintaining the same animation style but with different colors/signs creates recognizable patterns
   - User can immediately understand the meaning without additional explanations

2. Particle System Extensibility
   - The particle system's design makes it easy to add new particle types
   - Similar behaviors (movement, fading) can be reused while changing only the visual aspects
   - Specialized particle creation methods provide a clean interface for the rest of the application
   - New particle types can be added with minimal changes to the core animation system

3. Component State Tracking
   - Milestone detection requires components to track both current and previous values
   - Integer division provides an efficient way to detect threshold crossings (e.g., $1000 intervals)
   - Storing previous_cost alongside accumulated_cost enables change detection between updates
   - Visual feedback is triggered by state changes rather than absolute values

4. Visual Hierarchy Considerations
   - Financial feedback appears above the component, drawing attention without obscuring the component itself
   - Upward floating movement keeps the UI clean and prevents overlap with other elements
   - Fading effect ensures temporary feedback doesn't permanently clutter the interface
   - Emoji usage (💸) adds visual interest and reinforces the financial nature of the feedback

## Historian Chart Visualization Customization
- The HistorianManager class handles all chart visualization for historical data
- Data series are displayed with specific colors defined in the self.colors dictionary
- The visibility of data series is controlled by toggle buttons in the control panel
- Default visibility can be set by checking/unchecking buttons in multiple places:
  * create_toggle_button method sets initial toggle button state
  * create_line_for_data method sets initial line visibility
  * clear_chart method resets toggle buttons to their default states
- When customizing defaults, ensure all three locations are updated consistently
- Some series use the primary y-axis, while financial series use the secondary y-axis
- The update_axis_visibility method ensures the secondary axis only appears when needed

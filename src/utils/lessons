# ALPHA VERSION CODEBASE LESSONS & INSIGHTS
# ===================================
# This file records important learnings about the codebase

## Alpha Version Architecture
1. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. UI components are managed by specialized controller classes
3. Simulation logic is encapsulated in the SimulationEngine
4. Component system provides extensible power system modeling

BorderedMainWidget uses a flash system with different color palettes for different types of notifications, with timer-based animations.

UI animations with sequential color changes can create a more visually engaging effect than alternating patterns
Component initialization order is critical - ensure windows are fully initialized before loading scenarios to prevent display issues
QTimer.singleShot() can be used to create sequential animations without the need for a dedicated animation framework
When animating UI components that have functional signals, temporarily disconnect them to prevent unintended side effects during animations

Alpha users need clear instructions on bypassing OS security for unsigned apps (Windows/macOS).

Tab key can cause issues as a global hotkey when compiled on Windows; switched to Backslash.
README needs sufficient detail on core features like panels, views, Autocomplete, and metrics (CAPEX/IRR) for alpha users.

- Noted that README.txt now utilizes emojis and reorganized sections for better alpha user guidance.

- GitHub Actions workflows should include documentation files (like README.txt) alongside executables in distribution artifacts.

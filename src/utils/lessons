# ALPHA VERSION CODEBASE LESSONS & INSIGHTS
# ===================================
# This file records important learnings about the codebase

## Alpha Version Architecture
1. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. UI components are managed by specialized controller classes
3. Simulation logic is encapsulated in the SimulationEngine
4. Component system provides extensible power system modeling

BorderedMainWidget uses a flash system with different color palettes for different types of notifications, with timer-based animations.

UI animations with sequential color changes can create a more visually engaging effect than alternating patterns

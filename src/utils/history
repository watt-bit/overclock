  * Changed 'profile' attribute to 'profile_type' to match actual LoadComponent implementation
- For BatteryComponent:
  * Changed 'capacity' to 'power_capacity'

## 2024-03-27 18:00 - Fixed Time Scrubber Crash Bug
- Fixed critical bug in the time scrubber functionality that caused the application to crash when moving the time slider
- Identified and corrected a parameter mismatch in the `minimal_analytics_update` method of `main_window.py`
- Problem: The method was passing positional arguments incorrectly to the `update_analytics` method in `AnalyticsPanel`
- The method was incorrectly passing 5 positional arguments plus a named argument `is_scrubbing=True`:
  * This caused a "multiple values for argument 'is_scrubbing'" error when moving the time slider
- Solution: Reorganized the method call to correctly provide parameters in the right order:
  * Set power_produced, power_consumed as 0
  * Passed current_time as self.simulation_engine.current_time_step
  * Set total_capacity as 0
  * Used is_scrubbing=True as a named parameter
- Eliminated the crash during scrubbing operations which improves usability
- Users can now freely scrub through the timeline without application crashes 

## 2024-03-27 19:00 - Fixed Connection Serialization Bug
- Fixed a critical bug in the save/load functionality where connections between components were not preserved correctly
- Problem: When loading a saved scenario, connections would be made between incorrect components
- Root cause analysis:
  * The component indexing in the save method was using `self.main_window.components.index()` which could produce inconsistent indices
  * The scene item order didn't always match the components list order, leading to index mismatches
  * Connections were incorrectly mapped to component indices during both save and load operations
- Solution:
  * Added a proper component_index_map in the save_scenario method to track exact indices of each component
  * Modified the save logic to use this explicit mapping instead of dynamic index lookup
  * Streamlined the connection creation in load_scenario to properly map to component indices
  * Added better error handling for invalid connection indices
  * Removed redundant connection.append calls (the Connection constructor already handles this)
- This ensures that saved scenarios will now correctly restore all connections between the right components
- Improves overall application reliability for save/load operations

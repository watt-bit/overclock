Modified main_window.py to import opaque_button_style from ui_initializer instead of duplicating the button style definition, improving maintainability.
Moved opaque_button_style from UIInitializer.initialize_ui method to module level in ui_initializer.py to make it properly importable by other modules.
Replaced static image in AugurTitleScreen with video player that displays titlevideo2.mp4 at 1600x900 pixels for 5 seconds before transitioning.
Enhanced AugurTitleScreen to use QGraphicsScene with logo overlay - added augurvibelogosmall.png at 300px width in bottom left corner over video.
Centered augurvibelogosmall.png logo on AugurTitleScreen and increased width from 300px to 700px for better visibility.
Updated play/pause button to use dedicated hover and press state images (playpausebuttonhover.png, playpausebuttonpress.png) instead of auto-generated states.
Updated reset, screenshot, and autocomplete buttons to use dedicated hover and press state images instead of auto-generated states.
Removed unused _create_lighter_pixmap and _create_darker_pixmap methods from IconStateButton class, simplifying the code since all buttons now use dedicated images.
Added black mask overlay to AugurTitleScreen that covers the entire video and logo area (1600x900) positioned on top of all other elements.
Added fade animation to AugurTitleScreen black mask using QTimer-based approach - fades from opaque to transparent over 250ms when video starts playing.
Fixed AugurTitleScreen layering by setting explicit Z-values: video (0), logo (1), black mask (2) to ensure mask appears on top of all elements.
Added fade-to-black animation in AugurTitleScreen that triggers at 9 seconds and fades the mask back to fully opaque over 1 second before transition.
Updated component indicators to use 3px rounded corners - modified battery, grid export, grid import, solar panel, wind turbine, and load components.

Fixed analytics container positioning in main_window.py resize handler to match ui_initializer.py (-340px from right edge).
Implemented selected component display logic - shows "no component selected" by default, updates to show component type + ID when selected, clears on deselection.
Updated selected component display text styling to match hover display colors - light gray (205,205,205) for component type, darker blue (80,150,225) for ID.
Resized SelectedComponentDisplay from 250px to 300px width and updated analytics container positioning from -340px to -390px to accommodate wider display.
Removed title bar from properties panel by replacing custom title bar widget with empty QWidget(), matching analytics and time controls panels.
Fixed properties panel width at 300px while keeping height dynamic by setting setFixedWidth(300) and setSizePolicy(Fixed, Preferred) on both dock and widget.
Changed properties panel positioning to fixed overlay system - panel positioned with right edge 90px from screen right and top edge 75px from screen top, repositions automatically on window resize like analytics container.
Fixed crash in properties_manager.py by removing call to deleted position_properties_panel_if_needed() method.
Added logic to startup_sequence.py to hide properties panel at the start of the startup sequence for a cleaner initial experience.
Fixed properties panel width bug by adding setFixedWidth(300) to properties_widget in properties_manager.py to prevent content from shrinking panel below 300px.
Modified grid import properties to move Load Profile button to separate line below dropdown selector, always visible but disabled unless Custom mode selected.
Enhanced Load Profile button styling to show grayed-out text when disabled for better visual feedback.
Updated grid import auto-charging button to use same styling as generator component with proper ON/OFF colors and hover states.

Applied same UI improvements to wind turbine properties - moved Load Profile button to separate line, always visible but disabled when not Custom mode, with proper disabled styling.
Applied same UI improvements to solar panel properties - moved Load button to separate line, always visible but disabled when not Custom mode, with proper disabled styling.
Modified bus properties Load State button to grey out text color (#888888) when disabled due to no load connections for better visual feedback.
Modified generator properties to always show output level controls regardless of operating mode, with inactive controls being disabled/greyed out instead of hidden.
Enhanced generator properties ramp rate limiter to grey out label text when disabled for consistent visual feedback.
Modified load properties to always show all controls regardless of demand mode, with inactive controls being disabled/greyed out instead of hidden.
Modified load properties Load button to be on separate row instead of same line as demand mode dropdown, matching grid import component UI pattern.

Converted SelectedComponentDisplay from QLabel to QPushButton with hover/pressed styling matching component open buttons, making it clickable to open properties panel.
Added particle effect (create_puff with 200 particles) to component deletion in ComponentDeleter.delete_component(), matching the effect used when components are added.
Added CSV format popup dialog to properties_manager._load_custom_profile() - shows spreadsheet.png image (200x200px) and format requirements before file selector opens.
Added blue dot bullet (•) with color #4A90E2 to beginning of all terminal messages in TerminalWidget.add_message() for better visual organization.
Modified TerminalWidget.add_message() to skip adding blue dot for empty messages or line breaks, preventing unnecessary dots on blank lines.

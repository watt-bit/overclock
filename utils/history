2025-04-01: Removed the step forward and step backward buttons from the simulation control panel in src/ui/main_window.py to simplify the UI. Users can now use only the time slider and the play/pause button for simulation time control. 

2025-04-01: Modified the time slider in src/ui/main_window.py to show a golden yellow color (RGB 255,215,0) for the portion of the groove that has been traversed, matching the connection line color. This provides a visual indication of simulation progress.

2023-07-10: Implemented clearing the properties panel when the user clicks on the background (deselects all components). Added a clear_properties_panel method to ComponentPropertiesManager class and modified the CustomScene's mouseReleaseEvent to detect clicks on empty areas.

2023-07-10: Enhanced background click behavior to also hide the properties panel when the user clicks on the background, providing a cleaner interface when no components are selected. 

2023-07-10: Modified the properties panel to prevent it from being docked. It can now only be used as a floating panel, ensuring a consistent UI experience. 

2023-07-10: Added a 200px spacer to the left of the reset button in the simulation control panel to improve UI layout and spacing.
